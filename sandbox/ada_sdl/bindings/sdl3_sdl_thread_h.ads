  -- * # CategoryThread
  -- *
  -- * SDL offers cross-platform thread management functions. These are mostly
  -- * concerned with starting threads, setting their priority, and dealing with
  -- * their termination.
  -- *
  -- * In addition, there is support for Thread Local Storage (data that is unique
  -- * to each thread, but accessed from a single key).
  -- *
  -- * On platforms without thread support (such as Emscripten when built without
  -- * pthreads), these functions still exist, but things like SDL_CreateThread()
  -- * will report failure without doing anything.
  -- *
  -- * If you're going to work with threads, you almost certainly need to have a
  -- * good understanding of thread safety measures: locking and synchronization
  -- * mechanisms are handled by the functions in SDL_mutex.h.
  --

  -- * this is what the API reference manual should look like for all intents and
  -- * purposes.
  -- *
  -- * Technical details, not for the wiki (hello, header readers!)...
  -- *
  -- * On Windows (and maybe other platforms), a program might use a different
  -- * C runtime than its libraries. Or, in SDL's case, it might use a C runtime
  -- * while SDL uses none at all.
  -- *
  -- * C runtimes expect to initialize thread-specific details when a new thread
  -- * is created, but to do this in SDL_CreateThread would require SDL to know
  -- * intimate details about the caller's C runtime, which is not possible.
  -- *
  -- * So SDL_CreateThread has two extra parameters, which are
  -- * hidden at compile time by macros: the C runtime's `_beginthreadex` and
  -- * `_endthreadex` entry points. If these are not NULL, they are used to spin
  -- * and terminate the new thread; otherwise the standard Win32 `CreateThread`
  -- * function is used. When `SDL_CreateThread` is called from a compiler that
  -- * needs this C runtime thread init function, macros insert the appropriate
  -- * function pointers for SDL_CreateThread's caller (which might be a different
  -- * compiler with a different runtime in different calls to SDL_CreateThread!).
  -- *
  -- * SDL_BeginThreadFunction defaults to `_beginthreadex` on Windows (and NULL
  -- * everywhere else), but apps that have extremely specific special needs can
  -- * define this to something else and the SDL headers will use it, passing the
  -- * app-defined value to SDL_CreateThread calls. Redefine this with caution!
  -- *
  -- * Platforms that don't need _beginthread stuff (most everything) will fail
  -- * SDL_CreateThread with an error if these pointers _aren't_ NULL.
  -- *
  -- * Unless you are doing something extremely complicated, like perhaps a
  -- * language binding, **you should never deal with this directly**. Let SDL's
  -- * macros handle this platform-specific detail transparently!
  --  

  --*
  -- * Create a new thread with a default stack size.
  -- *
  -- * This is a convenience function, equivalent to calling
  -- * SDL_CreateThreadWithProperties with the following properties set:
  -- *
  -- * - `SDL_PROP_THREAD_CREATE_ENTRY_FUNCTION_POINTER`: `fn`
  -- * - `SDL_PROP_THREAD_CREATE_NAME_STRING`: `name`
  -- * - `SDL_PROP_THREAD_CREATE_USERDATA_POINTER`: `data`
  -- *
  -- * Note that this "function" is actually a macro that calls an internal
  -- * function with two extra parameters not listed here; they are hidden through
  -- * preprocessor macros and are needed to support various C runtimes at the
  -- * point of the function call. Language bindings that aren't using the C
  -- * headers will need to deal with this.
  -- *
  -- * Usually, apps should just call this function the same way on every platform
  -- * and let the macros hide the details.
  -- *
  -- * \param fn the SDL_ThreadFunction function to call in the new thread.
  -- * \param name the name of the thread.
  -- * \param data a pointer that is passed to `fn`.
  -- * \returns an opaque pointer to the new thread object on success, NULL if the
  -- *          new thread could not be created; call SDL_GetError() for more
  -- *          information.

  -- *
  -- * \sa SDL_CreateThreadWithProperties
  -- * \sa SDL_WaitThread
  --  

  --*
  -- * Create a new thread with with the specified properties.
  -- *
  -- * These are the supported properties:
  -- *
  -- * - `SDL_PROP_THREAD_CREATE_ENTRY_FUNCTION_POINTER`: an SDL_ThreadFunction
  -- *   value that will be called at the start of the new thread's life.
  -- *   Required.
  -- * - `SDL_PROP_THREAD_CREATE_NAME_STRING`: the name of the new thread, which
  -- *   might be available to debuggers. Optional, defaults to NULL.
  -- * - `SDL_PROP_THREAD_CREATE_USERDATA_POINTER`: an arbitrary app-defined
  -- *   pointer, which is passed to the entry function on the new thread, as its
  -- *   only parameter. Optional, defaults to NULL.
  -- * - `SDL_PROP_THREAD_CREATE_STACKSIZE_NUMBER`: the size, in bytes, of the new
  -- *   thread's stack. Optional, defaults to 0 (system-defined default).
  -- *
  -- * SDL makes an attempt to report `SDL_PROP_THREAD_CREATE_NAME_STRING` to the
  -- * system, so that debuggers can display it. Not all platforms support this.
  -- *
  -- * Thread naming is a little complicated: Most systems have very small limits
  -- * for the string length (Haiku has 32 bytes, Linux currently has 16, Visual
  -- * C++ 6.0 has _nine_!), and possibly other arbitrary rules. You'll have to
  -- * see what happens with your system's debugger. The name should be UTF-8 (but
  -- * using the naming limits of C identifiers is a better bet). There are no
  -- * requirements for thread naming conventions, so long as the string is
  -- * null-terminated UTF-8, but these guidelines are helpful in choosing a name:
  -- *
  -- * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/149932/naming-conventions-for-threads
  -- *
  -- * If a system imposes requirements, SDL will try to munge the string for it
  -- * (truncate, etc), but the original string contents will be available from
  -- * SDL_GetThreadName().
  -- *
  -- * The size (in bytes) of the new stack can be specified with
  -- * `SDL_PROP_THREAD_CREATE_STACKSIZE_NUMBER`. Zero means "use the system
  -- * default" which might be wildly different between platforms. x86 Linux
  -- * generally defaults to eight megabytes, an embedded device might be a few
  -- * kilobytes instead. You generally need to specify a stack that is a multiple
  -- * of the system's page size (in many cases, this is 4 kilobytes, but check
  -- * your system documentation).
  -- *
  -- * Note that this "function" is actually a macro that calls an internal
  -- * function with two extra parameters not listed here; they are hidden through
  -- * preprocessor macros and are needed to support various C runtimes at the
  -- * point of the function call. Language bindings that aren't using the C
  -- * headers will need to deal with this.
  -- *
  -- * The actual symbol in SDL is `SDL_CreateThreadWithPropertiesRuntime`, so
  -- * there is no symbol clash, but trying to load an SDL shared library and look
  -- * for "SDL_CreateThreadWithProperties" will fail.
  -- *
  -- * Usually, apps should just call this function the same way on every platform
  -- * and let the macros hide the details.
  -- *
  -- * \param props the properties to use.
  -- * \returns an opaque pointer to the new thread object on success, NULL if the
